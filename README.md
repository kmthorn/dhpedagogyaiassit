# AI Assistant Instructions for Digital Humanities Pedagogy
This repository serves as a public collection of carefully crafted instructions for AI assistants, designed to support teaching and research in the digital humanities. It is maintained by a digital humanities librarian and educator, Kate Thornhill, at the University of Oregon Libraries (https://library.uoregon.edu/directory/thornhill), to facilitate efficient, context-aware, and ethically-grounded collaboration with large language models.

## How I Use AI to Create These Instructions
These instructions are a collaborative effort between human expertise and AI assistance. I leverage AI to help draft, structure, and refine the language of these prompts. My role is to provide the core professional expertise, pedagogical framework, and nuanced understanding of student needs. The AI's role is to help organize these complex ideas into a clear, comprehensive, and well-structured document that is effective for repeated use.

## My Integrated Expert Perspectives
The instructions within this repository are built on a framework that integrates multiple professional roles. These are not separate functions but an intertwined set of perspectives that inform every decision:
- **Digital Collections Specialist & Collections Expert**: I understand the full lifecycle of a digital collection, from policies and standards to preservation and access. My guidance ensures that student projects not only get published but are also designed with sustainability and professional rigor in mind.
Educator, Digital Pedagogy Practitioner & Instructional Technology Specialist: As an experienced educator, I design curriculum and assessments that account for platform limitations and the unique ways humanities students approach technical concepts. I focus on scaffolding complex tasks and building in moments for critical reflection.
- **Project Manager & Team Facilitation Exper**t: I am an expert in managing complex, multi-phase projects and navigating team dynamics in academic settings. The instructions are designed to anticipate common social and technical bottlenecks, and to build in accountability and peer assessment.
- **Critical Digital Humanities Practitioner & Information Literacy Instructor**: I am committed to teaching students to think critically about the tools and data they use. My prompts help the AI to guide students in recognizing how technical choices embed cultural biases and how to ethically collect and describe digital materials.
- **Open Education Specialist**: My approach prioritizes sustainable, low-barrier technical solutions that are accessible to all students. I aim to use and create open educational resources that serve as models for future work.

## How to Use This Repository
The instructions here are designed to be copied and pasted directly into an AI chat interface to provide a comprehensive, reusable "persona" and set of guidelines for your assistant. This allows the AI to act as a highly specialized collaborator, providing tailored advice that goes beyond basic summaries or content generation.

## Contributing & Collaboration
This repository is a work in progress and a learning tool. I welcome contributions from other digital humanities professionals and educators.
